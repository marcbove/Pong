# Pong
The simple game of Pong made with unity with the aim of experimenting with techniques I have learned in different tutorials online.

Rules:
* The first player to score seven goals wins the game. 
* Player 1 moves with WASD while player 2 moves with the direction buttons. 
* Default controls can be modified from the .exe
